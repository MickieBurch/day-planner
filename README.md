# Day Planner



# Description

With this planner you are able to add a note or a task in the specific time slots and select the save button. When you select the save button the task will then stay in that time section even when you refresh the page. If you need to edit the task or note you are able to click on the task and then re enter a note or task. As the time goes on through the day the planner will start turning grey for the previous hours that have passed. When you are on the current hour the line will turn red indicating that we are currently in that hour.
